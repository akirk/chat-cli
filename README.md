# cli-chatgpt

A simple command line chatbot using [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) that uses streaming for faster responses.

Before you can use this you need to make your [OpenAI Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) available as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then run the script:

```bash
php chat.php
```

It will keep your input history in a readline file `.history` (so that you can go back to old prompts using the up-key).

It will also keep the conversation history in a directory `chats/` unless you prefix your input with whitespace, in that case the message and its response won't be kept.

I recommend using an alias in your shell to have it available anywhere in your command line: `alias cgt='php ~/chatgpt/chat.php'`
